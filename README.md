## Installation: A Gateway to Computational Elegance

`python-fsa` leverages the power of `pygraphviz` for its stunning visualizations, which in turn requires the foundational Graphviz C library. To ensure a flawless installation, follow these steps, paving your way to computational mastery:

1.  **Install Graphviz:** Secure your foundation by installing Graphviz from the [official website](https://graphviz.org/download/). Crucially, ensure its `dot` executable is meticulously placed within your system's PATH for seamless integration.

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:** Arm your Python environment with the necessary components:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install graphviz
    ```

3.  **Install `python-fsa` in Editable Mode (for development/CLI tools):** Unlock the full potential of the project by installing it in editable mode, allowing real-time modifications and direct access to its powerful CLI tools:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Usage: Orchestrating Your Automata

### Interactive FSM Creation (`fsm_creator.py`)

Embark on your FSM design journey with this guided interactive experience. Define your DFA or NFA with precision, and watch as it generates both a `.dot` file for visual splendor and a `.json` file for future programmatic endeavors.

```bash
python fsm_creator.py
```

Follow the intuitive prompts to sculpt your automaton. Upon completion, you'll be presented with the option to immediately launch `main3-0.py`, allowing you to instantly test the computational prowess of your newly forged FSM.

### Advanced FSM CLI (`main3-0.py`)

This is your command center for interacting with the very fabric of finite state machines. Load and test FSMs from a multitude of sources, including the meticulously crafted JSON files from `fsm_creator.py` or the visually expressive DOT graph files.

**Load from JSON and test:**

```bash
python main3-0.py --load-from my_fsm.json
```

**Load from DOT file and test:**

```bash
python main3-0.py --dot-file assets/dot_files/dfa_example.gv
```

Once within the interactive testing realm, you possess the power to input strings for immediate acceptance/rejection analysis or invoke the `step` command for a captivating, symbol-by-symbol execution, revealing the automaton's internal journey.

### DOT File Customization (`dot_customizer.py`)

Transform your FSM diagrams into works of art. This utility provides the granular control necessary to programmatically modify and render existing DOT graph files. For instance, to visually emphasize the initial state:

```bash
python dot_customizer.py --input assets/dot_files/dfa_example.gv --output customized_dfa
```

Behold as `customized_dfa.dot` and `customized_dfa.png` emerge, with the initial state now boldly highlighted in red, a testament to your command over visual representation.

### Library Usage (Examples)

For those who prefer direct programmatic interaction, `python-fsa` offers a clean and powerful API.

**DFA Example:**

```python
from python_fsa import DFA

a, b = "a", "b"

dfa = DFA(
    alphabet=(0, 1),
    states=(a, b),
    initial=a,
    transitions={
        (a, 0): a,
        (a, 1): b,
        (b, 0): b,
        (b, 1): a,
    },
    final=(a,),
)

print(dfa.accepts((0, 1, 1, 0)))  # Output: True
print(dfa.accepts((0, 0, 0, 1)))  # Output: False
```

**NFA Example:**

```python
from python_fsa import NFA

a, b, c = "a", "b", "c"

nfa = NFA(
    alphabet=(0, 1),
    states=(a, b, c),
    initial=a,
    transitions={
        (a, 0): (a,),
        (a, 1): (a, b),
        (b, 0): (c,),
        (b, 1): (c,),
    },
    final=(c,),
)

print(nfa.accepts((0, 1, 1, 0)))  # Output: True
print(nfa.accepts((0, 0, 0, 1)))  # Output: False

# Convert NFA to DFA
dfa_from_nfa = nfa.to_dfa()
print(dfa_from_nfa.accepts((0, 1, 1, 0))) # Output: True
```
